# Self Driving Car Simulation


This project is a self-driving car simulation implemented in JavaScript. It provides a platform to experiment with autonomous vehicle control using neural networks in a simulated environment.

## Features

- Car Simulation: Simulate the movement and control of a self-driving car.
- Neural Network: Design and train neural networks to control the car's behavior.
- Road Generation: Generate various road environments for testing the car's performance.
- Visualization: Visualize the neural network architecture and road environments.


## Installation

To run the simulation locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/DManLucas/Self_Driving_Car
```
2. Open the index.html file in a web browser.
3. Explore the simulation features.
## Usage/Examples
- Car Simulation: Use the arrow keys to control the car manually. Press the spacebar to switch to autonomous mode and let the neural network control the car.
- Neural Network: Modify the neural network architecture in the code to experiment with different control strategies.
- Road Generation: Adjust parameters in the Road class to generate custom road environments.
- Visualization: Explore the Visualizer class to customize the visualization of neural networks and road environments.

Below are some examples of how to use the simulation:

1. Basic Usage: Run the simulation with default settings to observe the car's behavior.
2. Custom Neural Network: Design a neural network with specific architecture and train it to navigate complex road environments.
3. Advanced Road Generation: Experiment with different road layouts and obstacles to test the car's adaptability.
